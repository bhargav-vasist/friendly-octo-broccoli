00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,360
Hello my loves.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,020
Welcome to a Guided Meditation by Lavendaire.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,680
I’m happy you made the choice to meditate today,

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,910
and nurture your body, mind, and soul.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,740
Let’s get into a comfortable seated position.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,140
Close your eyes.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,140
Now, bring your hands together 
and take a moment for gratitude.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,500
Focus on what you have to be grateful for today.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,840
I am grateful for this new day.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,200
I am grateful to be alive.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,760
I am grateful for my loved ones.

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,269
I am grateful for the sun, our earth, and the air I breathe.

13
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:41,420
I am grateful for this moment of peace.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,820
Release your hands back to your knees.

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,440
You can choose to face your palms up for receiving,
or down for grounding.

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,260
Take 3 deep breaths with an open mouth exhale.

17
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,180
Feel the relaxation flow through your body.

18
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,900
Then, close your mouth

19
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,020
and breathe through your nose for 
the rest of this meditation.

20
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,740
We’ll start with bringing awareness to 
and relaxing the entire body.

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,200
Relax your forehead and your eyebrows.

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Relax all your facial muscles.

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,440
Breathe in, and on your exhale, 
relax your shoulders down.

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,400
Relax your arms.

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,120
Relax your hands and your fingertips.

26
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,720
Relax your heart.

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,180
Relax your stomach.

28
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:14,480
Relax your hips, your thighs, your knees.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,740
Relax your calves.

30
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,560
Relax your feet.

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,800
Relax your toes.

32
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,160
Feel your entire body totally relax.

33
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,120
Allow yourself to simply feel the stillness 
of this moment.

34
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,320
You may notice your breath slowing down

35
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,140
as your body calms down and finds stillness.

36
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,960
Allow your breath to flow naturally.

37
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,420
Just observe how your body naturally 
breathes in and out.

38
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,980
Be the observer of your breath.

39
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,880
Your body already knows what to do.

40
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,340
If you notice thoughts entering your mind,
don’t worry or judge.

41
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,260
Simply observe the thought, then let it go.

42
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,740
Your thoughts are like clouds.

43
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,260
A thought might drift across your mind and
morph into another thought.

44
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,400
You don’t need to do anything but observe,
then release.

45
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,660
Like clouds, let them come and go.

46
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,660
If you want, you can try this visualization:

47
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,520
As you breathe in, imagine positive light energy

48
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,900
coming into your body through your crown,

49
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,290
which is the very top point of your head.

50
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,320
As you breathe out,

51
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,640
imagine that positive energy flowing through your body,

52
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,660
all the way down your limbs,

53
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:54,860
and pushing old, stagnant energy out 
through the tips of your toes.

54
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,100
Breathe in positive, loving energy.

55
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,620
Breathe out, and let that positive energy 
flow through you,

56
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,140
washing away any negative thoughts, energy,

57
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,800
and emotions that aren’t serving you.

58
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,920
Continue this visualization with your breath.

59
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,840
In doing so, you’re essentially trading

60
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,910
low vibrational energy for high vibrational energy.

61
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,480
We are energetic beings.

62
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,460
We must learn to protect our energy

63
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:35,160
and consciously choose to feed the positive 
and release the negative.

64
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,920
As you feel the positive light energy surrounding you,

65
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,680
feel free to recite these positive affirmations 
along with me, in your mind.

66
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,060
I am worthy as I am.

67
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,600
I am enough as I am.

68
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,920
I am strong, I am brave, I am resilient.

69
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:19,380
I love myself, respect myself, 
and accept myself exactly as I am.

70
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,000
I am guided, I am protected, I am loved.

71
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,300
I am safe.

72
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,360
I can express myself freely.

73
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,020
I choose love over fear.

74
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,640
I am a lightworker and I lead with light.

75
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,900
I am authentic to who I am and 
aligned with what I want.

76
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,900
Now you have the tools to relax 
your entire physical body,

77
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,300
renew your energetic body with positive light energy,

78
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,640
and reset your mind with positive, loving affirmations.

79
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,260
These exercises are available to you 
whenever you need them.

80
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,040
Continue meditating on your own.

81
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,080
Breathe, and connect with the stillness within.

82
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,600
Begin to bring your awareness back to your breath.

83
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,660
Bring your hands together and return to your gratitude.

84
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,680
What about your life are you grateful for?

85
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,980
Take 3 deep breaths with an open mouth exhale.

86
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,480
Open your eyes and see the beautiful world around you.

87
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,220
Observe your surroundings with a fresh perspective,

88
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,160
and continue your day with positivity and gratitude.

89
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,980
Sending you love and light.

90
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,960
Namaste.
