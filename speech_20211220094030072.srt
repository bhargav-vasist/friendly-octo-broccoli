00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,060
Hey, there.

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,300
Are you feeling a strong impulse
to do something right now?

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,820
An itching uncontrollable desire to do

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,900
something that you think you
probably shouldn't be doing it.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,920
Could be wanting to buy something in haste

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,640
because we've had a crappy day or binge
eating an entire tub of of ice cream

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,220
and two entire plates of nachos or texting
someone we know we shouldn't be texting.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,000
Controlling impulsive behavior
can be a tremendous challenge.
